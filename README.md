# noiseometer

Tired of those guys revving their motorcycles and setting off car alarms outside your window at 6am? Interested to know which nights are noisier than others? Ever wonder how much effect noise pollution has on your life? Noiseometer is a project to setup a network of noise level detectors to allow visualizing noise pollution across a wide area. Think weather underground but for noise pollution. Bring awareness to noise pollution in your area!

This project uses the new Arduino MKR1000 that is natively IoT capable along with the Sparkfun Sound Detector to sense noise level data and send it to a cloud data visualization system.
